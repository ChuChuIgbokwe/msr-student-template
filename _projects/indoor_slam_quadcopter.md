## Overview 
 The long term goals of this project is to implement real-time SLAM, autonomous flight,obstacle avoidance and object detection on a quadcopter equipped with a PandaBoard and an ASUS XTION PRO. The project builds off previous work that got SLAM working on a laptop, and radio controlled flight of the quadcopter. Fusing these two parts is the major objective of this project. The SLAM code used in this project was written from the ground up, including drivers for the ASUS Xtion PRO. The code works, however it is not optimised for the PandaBoard. The solution to this was to use ROS (Robot Operating System) as it has pre-existing packages for SLAM and algorithms can easily be written for autonomy, obstacle avoidance and object Detection.

##Overview
Over the course of one quarter divided into five sprints we implemented scrum and agile management techniques to develop an app called Nacht.

Nacht is an application that provides real-time demographic information on local nightlife destinations. By collecting and analyzing anonymous data we are able to monitor how full a bar is, the male/female ratio and the average age of the bar’s population. In addition we are also able to display which of the potential user’s closest Facebook friends are actually at a given bar at that moment, dramatically decreasing the uncertainty regarding whether or not your friends will truly be attending an event.

To verify we were actually solving a problem we tested our hypothesis over four sprints on about multiple social events using texts, Facebook updates and Snapchat updates. Afterwhich we created a webapp mvp that worked on Android phones before commencing work on a proper app.

## Overview
Baxter first scans an AR tag used for estimating the location of a Christmas stocking. He then scans a QR code that tells him which object on the table to place into the stocking. The camera mounted in the hand is then used to detect the desired object on the table and estimate its location. The IR range sensor in the hand is then used to help detect the distance to the object as the gripper attempts to grasp the object. If the object is successfully picked up, it is then placed into the stocking.

###Homework 1

Design a circuit using the PIC32MX250F128B to control a few LEDs. LED1 will toggle every 1/2 second and LED2 has a brightness proportional to the potentiometer voltage

###Homework 2 
Create the schematic for your board, matching your breadboarded PIC32. Connect all of the pins to headers so that your board mates with the proto board.

###Homework 3
Create the board layout for your PIC
Generate your gerber files and test at mayhewlabs.

###Homework 4 
Interface with the I2C OLED LCD to display text on the screen 

###Homework 5
Add accelerometer and display bars proportional to the X and Y acceleration due to gravity on the OLED display


###Homemwork 6
Get the Harmony project “blinky_leds” working on our board.

###Homework 7
Use the accelerometer data to control mouse on screen using the Harmony project hid_mouse.

###Homework 8
Harmony - hid_basic - PIC and computer will transmit information


###Homework 9
Laser cutting and 3D printing - design a bendy box and a wheel

###Homework 10
Test the Hello World code built into Android Studio. Follow the instructions at the Android Developer page to make your first app

###Homework 11
Harmony - hid_basic - PIC will transmit acceleration information to the computer MATLAB - design MAF to smooth data and FIR coefficients to reduce noise

###Homework 12
CameraDemo

###Homework 13
AndroidHID

###Homework 14
STL and DXF files of wheel and car

###Homework 15
AndroidHumanLineFollower

###Homework 16
PIC and Android code for car to follow a line

###Tech Cup
In order to complete a lap for the Tech Cup, an app needed to be created for the Android phone and code had to be written for motor operation:

1. Android app consists of communication over CDC serial port from Android phone to PIC, as well as image processing of the camera stream to find the center of mass (COM) of a line
2. PIC code receives the COM from CDC serial port over USB and tells the motors to operate accordingly

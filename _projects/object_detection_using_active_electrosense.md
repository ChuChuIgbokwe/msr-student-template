## Overview 
 Our universityâ€™s Neuroscience and Robotics (NxR) lab has developed an aquatic SensorPod robot, an implementation of biological active electrosense used by certain fish for object detection. Differential voltage sensors on the Sensor Pod can measure the distortion in the electric field as it passes by an object and generate a voltage profile at the zero crossing.The distortion in the electric field caused by the object due to its differing conductivity from water can be used to classify the object based on its shape. Due to time constraints, we will generate electrosense data using COMSOL and add noise. We will use this data to train a machine learning algorithm to identify spheroids of various aspect ratios.

##OBJECTIVES#
* Use the ROS [camera calibration] (http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration) package to calibrate the webcam you are given
* Follow the documentation for the package to try and get the package running
 - Build some sort of 3D holder for your LEDs and calculate the transforms between them
 - Build a circuit for powering the LEDs
 - Fine-tune parameters of the tracking algorithm
* Build a ROS package to run the demo
